[{"content":"Introduction # Welcome to part one of a multipart blog series that will guide you through self-hosting a website or service like a VPN. Today, we embark on a journey through the intricate world of domains—those digital addresses that give our websites a unique identity. Whether you\u0026rsquo;re a seasoned web developer or newbie, understanding what a domain is and how to acquire one is a crucial step towards establishing an online presence.\nThe domain name is the part of the address that is unique to your website. For example, in \u0026ldquo;www.selfhost.com\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;selfhost\u0026rdquo; is the domain name while \u0026ldquo;.com\u0026rdquo; is the domain extension/top-level domain that comes after the domain name. Popular examples include .com, .org, .net, and country-specific extensions like .gh or .uk. Some domains also include subdomains like \u0026ldquo;www\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;app\u0026rdquo; that appear before the domain name. eg \u0026ldquo;app.selfhost.com\u0026rdquo;.\nWhat is a Domain? # In simple terms, a domain is the address that people use to access your website on the internet. It\u0026rsquo;s a unique identifier that allows users to locate and interact with your website. Domains typically consist of two main components: the domain name and domain extension.\nAcquiring a Domain from Cloudflare # Cloudflare, a renowned provider of web infrastructure services offers domain registrar services. Cloudflare also provides free SSL Certificates, DNSSEC and DDoS Protection for its customers. DNSSEC secures DNS records with cryptographic signatures to verify the authenticity of domains. To acquire a domain with Cloudflare, follow these steps:\n  Visit (www.cloudflare.com) and create an account if you haven\u0026rsquo;t already. It\u0026rsquo;s free and requires only an email address and a secure password.\n  Once logged in, navigate to the \u0026ldquo;Domain Registration\u0026rdquo; section and click on \u0026ldquo;Register Domain.\u0026rdquo;\n  Enter the desired domain name in the search bar. Cloudflare will display available domain options with various extensions. Choose the one that best suits your needs.\n  Proceed to the checkout process, review the terms and pricing, and complete the purchase.    Note that you will need to pay an annual fee starting at $8 to renew your domain       Acquiring a Domain from Dynadot # For cheaper and a wider array of domain extensions, Dynadot provides a straightforward process for acquiring your dream domain. I will however recommend you transfer your domain to Cloudflare as future guides will be referencing and utilizing Cloudflare services.
